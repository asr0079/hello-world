<h1>Surviving 1st year of Medical School as an Asthmatic</h1>
<p> My own experience as a pediatric asthma patient inspired me to become a physician. I want to research asthma an find a cure for it to give back to other asthmatics. I hope that my hard work, persistence, and determination can set an example for other aspiring doctors.</p>
<p> I will be updating this website with regular posts about my 1st year of medical school, starting in a few weeks. </p>
